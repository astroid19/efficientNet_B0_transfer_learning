# EfficientNet_B0 Transfer Learning Experimentation

This repository contains an implementation of transfer learning using the EfficientNet_B0 model for improving image recognition. The pre-trained weights of the EfficientNet_B0 model are used as a starting point for the new model, which is then fine-tuned on a specific dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.0 or later
- Conda environment with dependencies specified in `environment.yaml`
